# AlpacaFs

AlpacaFs is an F# <a href "https://alpaca.markets/">Alpaca</a> client API to algorithmically trade us equities.

# Documentation

As I continue to use this interface, I will be adding examples and documentations. For the meantime, this library follows similar although not exact structure to this Elixir <a href "https://hexdocs.pm/alpaca_elixir/AlpacaElixir.html">library</a>.

# Contribution

This library might have some bugs, so pull requests are welcome.
